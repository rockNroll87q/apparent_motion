# Apparent Motion
Apparent motion stimulation for Line Scanning fMRI


## Content

* `AM_mapping.py` is the code for mapping the squares with BrainVoyager & NeuroFeedback.
* `scanner_code` is the old code we used at 7T for the data we collected some time ago. There are two versions `ApparentMotion_fMRI_close.py` and `ApparentMotion_fMRI_far.py`. The only difference is the degree of eccentricity of the squares (5 and 8 respectively) but the only change is the excel file they call.
* `master_student_code` is the code that the master student, Alex, made for the project. It's made with Psychopy builder. The code presented here is the original version that served as the basis for the creation of `scanner_code`.
